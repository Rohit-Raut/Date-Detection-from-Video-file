	This code is a Python script for detecting events in a video file. 
	It does this by first importing the necessary libraries: cv2, urllib, json, pandas, datetime, time, numpy, subprocess, pytesseract, and matplotlib. 
	The code then defines a function called unix_time, but this function is not used in the rest of the code.

	The code then prompts the user to enter the name of a video file, which it opens and reads. 
	It then creates a cv2 object detector using the createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2 function, which is used to extract the background from the video frames. 
	The code then gets various properties of the video, such as its width and height, frame rate, and number of frames. 
	It also calculates the duration of the video in seconds and minutes.

	Next, the code creates an output video file in the MP4 format and begins a loop to read through each frame of the input video file. 
	For each frame, it applies the object detector to extract the background, and then uses findContours to detect contours in the frame. 
	If the area of any contour is above a certain threshold (1500 pixels), the code applies a Gaussian blur and color map to the frame, resizes the resulting image, and writes it to the output video file. 
	The code also displays the frame with the heatmap applied and saves it as an image file.
	The loop continues until all frames have been processed, at which point the code closes the input and output video files and ends.
